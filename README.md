==================

Magic Box modularizes Fuzz's magical implementation of Laravel's Eloquent models as injectable, masked resource repositories.

##### Magic Box has two goals:
1. To create a two-way interchange format, so that the JSON representations of models broadcast by APIs can be re-applied back to their originating models for updating existing resources and creating new resources.
2. Provide an interface for API clients to request exactly the data they want in the way they want.
