Laravel Magic Box
==================

Magic Box modularizes Fuzz's magical implementation of Laravel's Eloquent models as injectable,
masked resource respositories. The goal of Magic Box is to create a two-way interchange format, so that
the JSON representations of models broadcast by APIs can be re-applied back to their originating models
for updating existing resources and creating new resources.

### Installation
1. Register the custom Fuzz Composer repository: ```composer config repositories.fuzz composer https://satis.fuzzhq.com``` 
1. Register the composer package: ```composer require fuzz/magic-box```

### Testing
Just run `phpunit` after you `composer install`.

### Eloquent Repository
`Fuzz\MagicBox\EloquentRepository` implements a CRUD repository that cascades through relationships,
whether or not related models have been created yet.

Consider a simple model where a User has many Posts. EloquentRepository's basic usage is as follows:

Create a User with the username Steve who has a single Post with the title Stuff.
```
    $repository = (new EloquentRepository)
        ->setModelClass('User')
        ->setInput([
            'username' => 'steve',
            'nonsense' => 'tomfoolery',
            'posts'    => [
                'title' => 'Stuff',
            ],
        ]);

    $user = $repository->save();
```

When `$repository->save()` is invoked, a User will be created with the username "Steve", and a Post will
be created with the `user_id` belonging to that User. The nonsensical "nonsense" property is simply
ignored, because it does not actually exist on the table storing Users.

By itself, EloquentRepository is a blunt weapon with no access controls that should be avoided in any
public APIs. It will clobber every relationship it touches without prejudice. For example, the following
is a BAD way to add a new Post for the user we just created.

```
    $repository
        ->setInput([
            'id' => $user->id,
            'posts'    => [
                ['title' => 'More Stuff'],
            ],
        ])
        ->save();
```

This will delete poor Steve's first postâ€”not the intended effect. The safe(r) way to append a Post
would be either of the following:

```
    $repository
        ->setInput([
            'id' => $user->id,
            'posts'    => [
                ['id' => $user->posts->first()->id],
                ['title' => 'More Stuff'],
            ],
        ])
        ->save();
```

```
    $post = $repository
        ->setModelClass('Post')
        ->setInput([
            'title' => 'More Stuff',
            'user' => [
                'id' => $user->id,
            ],
        ])
        ->save();
```

Generally speaking, the latter is preferred and is less likely to explode in your face.

The public API methods that return models from a repository are:

1. `create`
1. `read`
1. `update`
1. `delete`
1. `save`, which will either call `create` or `update` depending on the state of its input
1. `find`, which will find a model by ID
1. `findOrFail`, which will find a model by ID or throw `\Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\ModelNotFoundException`

### TODO
1. Ship granular role-based ACL functionality.
1. Ship controller middleware.
1. Support more relationships (esp. polymorphic relations) through cascading saves.
